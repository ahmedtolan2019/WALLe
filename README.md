# WALLe
NASA Space App Challenge

# Our approach
We, in WALL.E team, create a great approach to solve the challenge we have already chosen. As we learned from the detail of the challenge, we will use AI and ML algorithms to provide a method for marine debris detecting, tracking, quantifying, and classifying. After collecting that data from different sources, we will discuss later in this slide, we will visualize that data using a responsive map. Firstly, our project consists of three main phases:
- Data collection
- Mapping and visualization
- End user experience

# Technologies
- Slam system 
- OpenCV 
- Lidar
- IR
